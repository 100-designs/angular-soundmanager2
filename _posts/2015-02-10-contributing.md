The first step in contributing to the code base is forking the repo.

##### Install dependencies

`npm install`

##### Run grunt to watch files to update `dist`

`grunt`


If you have an existing fork, make the repo is up-to-date. Always create the branch off the actively developed branch (typically develop or master)

### For bug fixes:

- Create a branch
- Once the bug has been fixed with sufficient testing submit a pull request
- If there is an existing open issue, reference the issue number in the pull request description.

### For new features:

Open a ticket thoroughly describing the feature. The more detail you provide, the better. After at least one of core developers responds or triages the ticket and says it's a go, follow the steps:

- Create a branch
- Once implemented with tests and documentation, submit a pull request referencing the open ticket.

### For documentation:

- Create a branch or edit the file
- Submit a pull request
